    <h2>AI Definition</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development
    of computer systems that can perform tasks typically
    requiring human intelligence. These tasks include
    problem-solving, understanding natural language,
    recognizing patterns, and making decisions.

        AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields
    and techniques, such as machine learning, natural
    language processing, robotics, and computer vision.</p>

    <h2>Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>
    <p>AI is used as voice assistants. Siri, Google Assistant,
and Alexa use AI to understand and respond to voice
commands. Platforms like Netflix and Amazon use AI to
recommend products or shows based on your previous
interactions. AI enables self-driving cars to navigate
roads and make driving decisions.</p>

    <h1>Key Concepts in AI</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI
that allows systems to learn from data and improve
over time without being explicitly programmed.
Examples include recommendation systems (like
Netflix or YouTube) and fraud detection.</li>
        <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP): A branch of AI
focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret,
and generate human language. Applications include voice
assistants like Siri or Alexa, chatbots, and language
translation systems.</li>
            <li>Computer Vision: Enables machines to interpret
and make decisions based on visual data from the world,
such as images and videos. It's widely used in facial
recognition, self-driving cars, and medical imaging.
